After teaching BFS on trees it seems like a good idea to move on to
different data structures where BFS also applies, mostly matrixes

NOTE:
IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE pop(0) to pop from left (start) NOT pop()
pop() causes the queue to pop from the right which causes the solution to act like DFS (LIFO)
we want BFS, so we should pop from the start pop(0) popping from the start, BFS (FIFO)

TODO:
In island problems I look for every position of '1' (land) and run BFS through it
if I have not already visited it, maybe there is a better way to find starting points.

Good problem to start of with that is:
  Medium:
  200 Number of islands
  1091 Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
