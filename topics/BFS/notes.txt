After teaching BFS on trees it seems like a good idea to move on to
different data structures where BFS also applies, mostly matrixes

NOTE:
IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE pop(0) to pop from left (start) NOT pop()
pop() causes the queue to pop from the right which causes the solution to act like DFS (LIFO)
we want BFS, so we should pop from the start pop(0) popping from the start, BFS (FIFO)


Good problem to start of with that is:
  Medium:
  200 Number of islands
  1091 Shortest Path in Binary Matrix
  751 Open the lock (NOTE: this problem showcases the time complexities of list vs set, ABSOLUTE MUST KNOW!!!!!)


NOTE: "399 Evaluate Division" seems like a great problem where it does not seem like the problem
can be solved with graphs and BFS, but you CAN turn it into graphs and BFS for a clean solution.


NOTE: "1971 Find if Path Exists in Graph" seems like a good Beginner level problem for BFS and Graphs.
