"""
NOTE: This is the initial try, it gets time limit exceeded, im not very good yet.
I also tried bitmasks which was seriously stupid since 2^500 is a large number :) (This one got memory limit exceeded... i am truly special)

NOTE: I peeked into the solutions tab and found one solution which mentioned depthMap,
so I switched back to the editor immediately and wrote a depth_map solution,
I still get TLE, but on the 53rd case (there are 57 in total).
So it is better, but still not good enough.

NOTE: I have now improved the time limit complexity significantly by keeping the depth_map and, adding the answers matrix and also adding visited set.
You can read what they are for in the comments below.
But the solution is still not complete, I am getting MLE since I am storing all shortest paths for every word in the answers matrix.
If I can fix that, I am confident this will be a successful submission!

NOTE: defaultdict is pretty cool.
It initializes the dictionary with default values. `defaultdict(list)` will have an empty array for every unassigned key.
You can also put lambda in it, `defaultdict(lambda: float("inf"))` here, every uninitialized key will have a float("inf") value.

NOTE: I finally got the code accepteeeddd no TLE or MLE ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.
Last issue I had was MLE, because I was storing every shortest path for every word in a matrix called answers.
Instead of doing that, you can create a parents dictionary which will hold set of parent words for every word.
Then you can use a simple backtrack function to assemble the arrays.
Thank you to ChatGPT for helping me out on this one.

NOTE: There is a way to speed this up using Bidirectional BFS but I think that would be a topic for another day.
TODO: Implement Bidirectional BFS.
