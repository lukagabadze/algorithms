"""
NOTE: ChatGPT Told me this was a hard problem to practice Dijkstras algorithm.
Well that was a fucking lie.

This problem is solved using DP + Binary Search.
It's really really awesome so I will be moving it to the DP folder.

I will still keep this implementation because it works (if you don't consider the fact it gets TLE ðŸ¤­).
