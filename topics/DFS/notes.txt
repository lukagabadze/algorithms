"1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree" is a really really good DFS problem!
Maybe not... turns out DFS and BFS have the same result in this problem (slightly better if you use BFS actually).
BUT, you can still teach DFS using this problem, why not, you can use a stack and keep on popping until you zigzag your way through the tree.
