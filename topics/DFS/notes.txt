"1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree" is a really really good DFS problem!
Maybe not... turns out DFS and BFS have the same result in this problem ~~(slightly better if you use BFS actually)~~ (actually, after running the DFS one more time, it got slightly better result than BFS).
BUT, you can still teach DFS using this problem, why not, you can use a stack and keep on popping until you zigzag your way through the tree.
