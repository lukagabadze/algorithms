NOTE: The main difference between Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm:
While Prim's algorithm constructs a tree based on neighbours and slowly adds to the tree,
Kruskal's algorithm just chooses nodes with the minimum weight throughout the graph.
They both assemble Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) but in 2 different fashions.
