- Python already provides functions for binary search from the bisect module, bisect_left and bisect_right.
It would be a good idea to implement binary search by hand first and then learn bisect_left/right.

- Good example of using binary search might be in Insertion Sort,
you can probably turn O(n^2) into O(n*log(n)) using binary search to find the insertion place
