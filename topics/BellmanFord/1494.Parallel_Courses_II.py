"""
NOTE: Funny thing:
    graph = [[]] * n

This does NOT work AT ALL.
When you push one element in the 0th array, it pushet it to all (object referrences baby).
The correct way to code this would be:
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]

NOTE: I am switching to Dijkstra to solve this problem.
But I really do believe this can be solved with Bellman-Ford (I am so fucking desperate to find Bellman-Ford problems ðŸ˜­)
Maybe keeping track of semesters and how many nodes can we put in that semester might be a key to solving this with Bellman-Ford (indexing the semesters).
    semesters = [k] * n * k
