"1514 Path with Maximum Probability" is a problem that can be solved with Bellman Ford's algorithm.
I solved it with Dijsktra and it passed, but the solution was very slow.
I read in the solutions tab that bellman ford algo beats 100% here.

UPDATE: I don't know where I read that Bellman-Ford gets 100% here but it definetely does not.
I will still solve it using Bellman-Ford though.

There are legit ZERO problems on leetcode which require Bellman-Ford, how the fuck am I supposed to practice it.
I will have to use a different platform to practice Bellman-Ford.
I am NOT solving 1514 with Bellman-Ford.
n = 10^4
m = len(edges) = 2 * 10^4
and the time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(n*m) so 10^8... EIGHT bro.
Fuck you, I will solve it just to prove how stupid it is.

NOTE: I just solved it and I am impressed, you can read the notes inside my code to know more but I am surprised.

NOTE: Checking for a negative-weight cycle is a part of what Bellman-Ford does well.
TODO: Find a problem where finding a negative-weight cycle is a solution.
