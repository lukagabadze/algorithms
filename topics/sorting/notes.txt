- I think best order to learn these algorithms would be from slowest to fastest.

So you would go
1) Bubble Sort
2) Insertion Sort
3) Selection Sort

4) Merge Sort - in this case, I think it's better to teach recursion first
and than move on to teaching merge sort.
Or, I might teach recursion using merge sort.
